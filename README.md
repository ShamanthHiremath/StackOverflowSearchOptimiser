## StackOverflow Search Optimizer

Welcome to the StackOverflow Search Optimizer repository! This project aims to streamline your experience when searching for solutions on StackOverflow by leveraging web scraping and summarization techniques.

### Overview

Have you ever found yourself spending too much time scrolling through StackOverflow answers trying to find the best solution to your coding problem? Look no further! Our solution automates this process for you, providing a concise and optimized answer based on the top-rated content.

### How it Works

1. **Web Scraping**: We scrape StackOverflow for answers to the question you intend to search. By analyzing the top-viewed or top-rated answers, we gather comprehensive data.
